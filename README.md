# Baked-Salmon-in-Foil
Bake your potatoes first as salmon needs less time in the oven. This way you’re guaranteed the potatoes will be cooked through when it’s all finished. I used fingerling potatoes in this recipe because we LOVE the flavour of them! You an also use Yukon golds or halved baby potatoes.
Once your potatoes are done, push them to the side and pile on your asparagus and salmon pieces.
Pour on all of your flavours.
Prepare an amazing garlic butter sauce with a hint of white wine (optional) and lemon juice.
Mince your garlic cloves.
Rub the minced garlic all over your salmon fillets.
Combine lemon juice with melted butter and pour it all over your salmon and asparagus.
Salmon only needs 8-10 minutes cooking time in a hot, preheated oven (400°F or 200°C). I broil/grill ours in the last 2 minutes of cook time to get those crispy, golden charred edges.
